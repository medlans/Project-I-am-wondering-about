xD
I miss the old scratch, The json editing scratch
The purple more blocks category scratch, the better cleanup scratch
I hate the new scratch, the really huge scratch
The single column scratch, pen extension scratch
I miss the old Scratch, the number only input scratch
I gotta say, at the time I loved Scratch, cat from Scratch
See they invented Scratch, there wasn't any Scratchs
And now I look and look around and there's so many scratchs
I used to love Scratch, I still love Scratch
I even had a Tips Window game, I thought I was Scratch
I used to love Scratch, I used to love Scratch
I miss the old Scratch, the json editing Scratch
I hate the new Scratch, the really huge Scratch
The single column Scratch, pen extension Scratch
See they invented Scratch, there wasn’t any Scratchs
And now I look and look around and there’s so many Scratchs
I miss the old Scratch, the really gray Scratch
The grayscale Scratch, the list dropdown Scratch
I hate the new Scratch, the really purple Scratch
The no block switching Scratch, useless extension Scratch
I miss the old Scratch, the early 2010s Scratch
I gotta say, at the time I loved Scratch, cat from Scratch
See they invented Scratch, there wasn’t any Scratchs
And now I look and look around and there’s so many Scratchs
I used to love Scratch, I still love Scratch
I even stole from Help, I thought I was Scratch
I used to love Scratch, I used to love Scratch
I miss the old Scratch, the really gray Scratch
I hate the new Scratch, the really purple Scratch
The single column Scratch, useless extension Scratch
See they invented Scratch, there wasn’t any Scratchs
And now I look and look around and there’s so many Scratchs
I used to love Scratch, I used to love Scratch
