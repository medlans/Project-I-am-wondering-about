I miss the old scratch, The json editing scratch  
The purple more blocks category scratch, the better cleanup scratch  
I hate the new scratch, the really huge scratch  
The single column scratch, pen extension scratch

I miss the old Scratch, the number only input scratch  
I gotta say, at the time I loved Scratch, cat from Scratch  
See they invented Scratch, there wasn't any Scratchs  
And now I look and look around and there's so many scratchs

I used to love Scratch, I still love Scratch  
I even had a Tips Window game, I thought I was Scratch  
I used to love Scratch, I used to love Scratch  
I miss the old Scratch, the json editing Scratch

I hate the new Scratch, the really huge Scratch  
The single column Scratch, pen extension Scratch  
See they invented Scratch, there wasn’t any Scratchs  
And now I look and look around and there’s so many Scratchs

I miss the old Scratch, the really gray Scratch  
The grayscale Scratch, the list dropdown Scratch  
I hate the new Scratch, the really purple Scratch  
The no block switching Scratch, useless extension Scratch

I miss the old Scratch, the early 2010s Scratch  
I gotta say, at the time I loved Scratch, cat from Scratch  
See they invented Scratch, there wasn’t any Scratchs  
And now I look and look around and there’s so many Scratchs

I used to love Scratch, I still love Scratch  
I even stole from Help, I thought I was Scratch  
I used to love Scratch, I used to love Scratch  
I miss the old Scratch, the really gray Scratch

I hate the new Scratch, the really purple Scratch  
The single column Scratch, useless extension Scratch  
See they invented Scratch, there wasn’t any Scratchs  
And now I look and look around and there’s so many Scratchs  

I used to love Scratch, I used to love Scratch
